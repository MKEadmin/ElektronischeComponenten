## Description
 Description of the SRD-03VDC-SL-C Relay
The SRD-03VDC-SL-C is an electromechanical relay commonly used to control high-voltage or high-current devices (like lamps, motors, etc.) using a low-voltage control signal (e.g., from a microcontroller).

üîç Key Specifications

Parameter	Description
Coil Voltage	3 V DC
Operating Voltage Range	~2.25 V ‚Äì 3.75 V
Coil Resistance	~70 Œ©
Switching Voltage	Up to 250 VAC or 30 VDC
Switching Current	Up to 10 A
Type	SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) ‚Äì COM, NO, NC
Trigger Signal	Active LOW (on most relay boards)
Isolation	Optocoupler (on some boards) and separate power rails

This relay is typically mounted on a relay module that includes a transistor, flyback diode, and indicator LED, since the raw relay coil draws too much current for a GPIO pin.

‚öôÔ∏è MicroPython Example

Below is an example for an ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico (W) running MicroPython, controlling an SRD-03VDC-SL-C relay via a GPIO pin.

üß† Circuit
	‚Ä¢	VCC (3V3 or 5V) ‚Üí Relay module VCC (check your board)
	‚Ä¢	GND ‚Üí Relay module GND
	‚Ä¢	GPIO Pin (e.g., Pin 15) ‚Üí Relay module IN

‚ö†Ô∏è If your relay module is active LOW, setting the pin LOW turns it ON, and HIGH turns it OFF.

‚∏ª
üß∞ Troubleshooting Tips
	‚Ä¢	If the relay doesn‚Äôt click, check that:
	‚Ä¢	The relay board supports 3 V logic (some need 5 V).
	‚Ä¢	The GND of your relay module and microcontroller are connected.
	‚Ä¢	The coil voltage matches (SRD-03VDC ‚Üí 3 V coil; don‚Äôt confuse with SRD-05VDC, SRD-12VDC, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	If it‚Äôs always ON or always OFF, your module might be active HIGH instead ‚Äî just invert the logic.

Would you like me to show a MicroPython example for multiple relays (e.g., 2 or 4 channels) as well?

## Installation libraries
Copy next files to the Raspberry Pi Pico

```bash

```

## Example code
```python
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

# Define the GPIO pin connected to the relay module input
relay = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)

# Active LOW relay logic
def relay_on():
    relay.value(0)   # turn ON (LOW signal)
    print("Relay ON")

def relay_off():
    relay.value(1)   # turn OFF (HIGH signal)
    print("Relay OFF")

# Initialize with relay off
relay_off()

# Test loop
while True:
    relay_on()
    sleep(2)
    relay_off()
    sleep(2)
```
